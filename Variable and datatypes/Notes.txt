# run js file:
 1.make a html file and run on live server, click right and do inspect
 2. in inspect , there is a console on the right half 
 3.make a js file like "variable.js" , js is the extension of JavaScript
 4. assign  variables with value and write "console.log(variableName)"
  and go to step 2's place( the console part)
  in console it will show the variable's value that you wanted to print

# suppose 
  fullname=" tony stark"
  console.log(fullname)
  it will show the string "tony stark" in the console 
  but  if you again assign fullname=23, 
  it will replace the sting tony stark with a in value 23
   so the updated fullname will be 23 not tony stark

# JavaScript is case sensitive, fullname and FULLNAME are not same thing
 
# Variable names that are valid in JavaScript
fullname 
_fullname
$fullname
fullname112

# 3 proper way to declare a variable name-
1.let - variable can not be  re-declared but can be updated,  a block scope variable 
2.var - variable can be re-declared and updated, a global scope variable (not recommended) 
3.const -(constant value) variable can not be re-declared or updated,  a block scope variable

* if (let)  variable is not assign wih value then it's output will be undefined
 let a;
 console.log(a);
 output: undefined
 * if (const) variable is not assign wih value then it will show an error


 * block in js is { .....}

 {
    let a = 10;
    console.log(a);
}
{
    let a = 20;
    console.log(a);
}
value wont be updated. output will be print as 10 20
# data types in JavaScript: number,string boolean, null,undefined,bigint,symbol

#object:
format:
 const objectname{
key: value,
key:value,....

};
typeof variablename will be object

console.log(student["age"]);// 23
//or
console.log(student.age);// 23
